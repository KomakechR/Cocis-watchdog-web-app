\section{INTRODUCTION}

In this internet age, access to information has become a fundamental human right especially in developed countries where the well-being of citizens is put at the forefront. It is therefore unfortunate that in developing countries the process to information access has taken on a rather slower path. With emphasis focused around College of Computing and Information Sciences (COCIS), Cocis Watchdog is a web platform developed specifically to keep students up to date with the activities taking place at the college by constantly providing information about; dates for coming tests, dates of upcoming events to be organized at the college, results from college elections, internship as well as job opportunities etc.
